I worked with the <a href="http://www.no-place-to-go.com/">No Place to Go</a> organizers and all 15 artists to create an app that enabled the socially distanced haunted house. The app coordinated the motion of single-car groups that rotated through five different locations. The app also reflected each artist's (or artist group's) vision for bringing more interactivity and context to their installations.
