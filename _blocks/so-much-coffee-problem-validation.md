title: Problem Validation
---

I wanted to solve many problems with my design but I felt that a coffee timer and a shop directory would be the most achievable with my time and skills as well as line up the best with what users were looking for. I found out through interviewing that almost everyone has their own way of finding a coffee shop but I was almost the only person looking for a better coffee brewing timer. When I need to narrow to scope of what I was building I knew what to do.
