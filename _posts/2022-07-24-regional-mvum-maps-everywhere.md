In a previous post, I was puzzled about why I [could not find more regional maps]({% post_url 2022-04-04-web-example-mvum-collection %}) showing where the various MVUM maps were located. If "R5" was (for some reason) the Pacific Southwest, I figured there was a good chance that at least R1-R4 existed too, so I started digging around. An internet search for "R5 MVUM" took me to the [full page R5 map](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd614063.html) that I added to the previous post. I then clicked on "Maps & Publications" to get to [https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r5/maps-pubs](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/r5/maps-pubs). One link there got me to another full-page map for R4, and this had a URL clearly showing the region ([https://www.fs.fed.us/mapfinder/?r=04](https://www.fs.fed.us/mapfinder/?r=04)).

The loading performance of these maps in Safari is incredibly bad and doesn't always complete, but They have the right idea. In Chrome, they seem to be loading reliably.
