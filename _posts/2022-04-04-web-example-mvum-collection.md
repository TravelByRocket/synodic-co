I came across a surprisingly good example of what I am trying to achieve in the [R5 (Pacific Southwest Region) MVUM & OSVUM Finder](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/cleveland/maps-pubs/?cid=fseprd639835) ([and full page equivalent](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd614063.html)) with my native iOS experience. The web experience is pretty bad, but the intended map discovery path (map rectangles on a larger map in order to place them in more useful context) is almost identical. What I can't figure out is why I have not found an equivalent map for any other area in the United States.
