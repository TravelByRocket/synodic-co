I worked with the <a href="http://www.no-place-to-go.com/">No Place to Go</a> organizers and all 15 artists to create an app that enabled the socially distanced haunted house. The app coordinated the motion of single-car groups that rotated through five different locations. The app also reflected each artist's (or artist group's) vision for bringing more interactivity and context to their installations. 

Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/TravelByRocket/no-place-to-go">GitHub</a>.
