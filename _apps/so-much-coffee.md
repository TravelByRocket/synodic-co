title: "So Much Coffee"
---

I believe there are no great tools to explore the world of coffee so I set out to make my own. I took a product management approach to designing an app that lets users find the best coffee shops, discover roasters, and navigate roasts among other tasks. After a period of research I developed this app for my thesis in Creative Technologies & Design. Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/TravelByRocket/so-much-coffee">GitHub</a>.
