title: Motivation and Background
---

As a big coffee fan, I believe that there are so many things to enjoy about coffee besides just the caffeine in each of those beans. I wanted to get more into coffee in many ways but it can quickly get very complicated to answer very simple questions. Questions like: 
- Where is the closest coffee shop with great coffee? 
- How can I improve the coffee I make it home? 
- How do I explore the range of coffee flavors?
There is no map to explore the complex world of coffee, which is why I set out to use my technical background, a product management approach, user-centered design, and an eye for detail to make loving coffee more accessible.
